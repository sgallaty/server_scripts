# server_scripts
Scripts for managing and updating dedicated servers on steam

To utilize, rename the example config.conf.example to config.conf and modify it to suit.  
Generally this means putting in the right appid of the dedicated server you want to use, 
and the name of the ID you have created for that dedicated server.

I recommend running servers which want interaction in a "screen session" - you can find 
good screen tutorials on google.
